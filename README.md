## ✨ Problem it Solves

Nowadays, people use multiple accounts across different platforms (personal, school, work, etc.), each with unique emails and passwords.
This often leads to forgetting credentials or mixing them up.

**Password Management System** solves this by creating a local database where users can securely store, categorize, and manage all their accounts.
